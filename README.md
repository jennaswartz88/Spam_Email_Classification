# **Spam Classification Using Machine Learning**  

## **Overview**  
Spam emails and messages are a persistent nuisance, cluttering inboxes and sometimes posing security risks. The ability to automatically classify messages as spam or not spam (ham) is an essential application of machine learning. This project applies various classification techniques to build an effective spam detection model.  

## **What This Project Covers**  
- **Preprocessing & Feature Engineering**: Tokenization, stopword removal, TF-IDF, and bag-of-words representation.  
- **Machine Learning Models**:  
  - **Logistic Regression**  
  - **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**  
  - **Random Forest Classifier**  
  - **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**  
  - **Na√Øve Bayes Classifier**  
- **Model Evaluation & Optimization**: Cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, precision-recall trade-offs, and performance metrics (accuracy, F1-score, confusion matrix, ROC curves).  

## **What I Learned**  
Through this project, I deepened my understanding of:  
- **Text classification**: How different models process and classify textual data.  
- **Feature extraction**: Using TF-IDF and bag-of-words to convert text into numerical input for machine learning.  
- **Model selection & evaluation**: Understanding trade-offs between bias and variance in classification models.  
- **Performance metrics**: The importance of balancing precision and recall in spam detection to avoid misclassifications.  

## **Why This Matters**  
Spam detection is a critical real-world problem, and applying machine learning to it showcases the power of **automated classification systems**. This project demonstrates how different models handle classification tasks, their strengths and weaknesses, and how data-driven decision-making can improve performance.
